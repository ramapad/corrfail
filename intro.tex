\section{Introduction}

Even as residential users rely increasingly upon the Internet,
last-mile infrastructure continues to be vulnerable to diverse
factors, including weather~\cite{schulman-imc11}.

In this work, we distinguish between Internet outages and Internet
failures. An outage is just lack of connectivity to the Internet and
includes instances where users may voluntarily choose turn off their
equipment. A failure event, on the other hand, is unintentional, and
typically affects more than one address. Thus, failures are a subset
of outages.

Our goal is to use observed outages to infer Internet failure events.

Even in a world that increasingly relies upon the Internet, Internet failure
events, often affecting multiple users, are known to occur. Characterizing, and quantifying
such events is essential to understanding and improving Internet reliability.

In this paper, we develop and evaluate an approach to detect Internet
failure events that affect multiple users using measurements gathered with the
Thunderping technique. Thunderping detects an outage for an IP address
it is pinging when that address ceases to respond to its probes. Our
insight is that simultaneous outages of multiple ``related'' addresses
is indicative of an Internet failure event. Using a novel approach
based upon Binomial hypothesis testing, we detect instances of
simultaneous outages that are unlikely to have happened by random
chance and flag these as failure events.

We characterize Internet failure events and present results
that challenge conventional wisdom on how such outages affect Internet
address blocks. For example, we see that for X\% of such events
affecting at least Y addresses, Z\% had other addresses in an address
block that continued to be responsive to probes. 

We then go
on to segregate failure events into categories that suggest their
cause. Outages could result from a variety of causes, such as power
outages, network
outages due to an ISP's infrastructure failure, cable cuts etc.

\subsection{Correlated dropouts across ISPs}

How about saying we will consider a couple of different approaches? In
one, we will consider all correlated dropouts. In another, we will
consider the correlated dropouts that affect at least 95\% of the
addresses.

Give an ISP-level breakdown of both.

Perhaps begin with: is it dynamic addressing?

If it's dynamic addressing, does it depend upon the size?
